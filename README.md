# FCaching

Easy caching (in memory + files persistency) for Ruby objects.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fcaching', github: 'RDeckard/fcaching'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

### `FCaching#fetch` - the Swiss Army knife of caching

Basic usage - store and fetch:

```ruby
cache = FCaching.new

cache.fetch("key")
# => nil
# Nothing is stored yet for this key
cache.fetch("key") { "value" }
# => "value" # The block is evaluated, its result is cached and returned
cache.fetch("key")
# => "value" # The cached value is returned (even after restarting the script or application)
```

Fetch and update basic policy:

```ruby
cache = FCaching.new

# Store a new key/value
cache.fetch("key") { {a: 1, b: 2} }
# => {:a=>1, :b=>2}
cache.fetch("key") { {a: 2, b: 4} }
# => {:a=>1, :b=>2} # The block is not evaluated because of the existance of the cached value
cache.fetch("key", force: true) { {a: 2, b: 4} }
# => {:a=>2, :b=>4} # The cache is updated by force with the returned value of the block
```

Fetch and update policy based on time:

```ruby
cache = FCaching.new

# Store a new key/value
cache.fetch("key") { {a: 1, "b" => :value} }
# => {:a=>1, "b"=>:value}

sleep 2

cache.fetch("key", max_age: 1)
# => nil # The cache is not fetched because of its age
ruby_object = Object.new
# => #<Object:0x000056111cfb3d98>
cache.fetch("key", max_age: 3) { ruby_object }
# => {:a=>1, "b"=>:value} # The cached value is young enough so it is fetched, and the block is not evaluated

sleep 2

cache.fetch("key", max_age: 3) { ruby_object }
# => #<Object:0x000056111cfb3d98> # The cache is updated by the block because of its outdated age (sorry dude)
```

### Other "Low level" methods

`FCaching#set` and `FCaching#get` and `FCaching#delete`:

```ruby
cache = FCaching.new

cache.get("key")
# => nil
cache.set("key", "nothing")
# => true
cache.get("key")
# => "nothing"
cache.set("key", "something")
# => true
cache.get("key")
# => "something"

sleep 2

cache.get("key", max_age: 1)
# => nil
cache.get("key", max_age: 3)
# => "something"

cache.del("new_key")
# => 0
cache.del("key")
# => 1
cache.del("key")
# => 0
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
